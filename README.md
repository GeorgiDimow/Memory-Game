# Memory Game
 Welcome to my Memory Game! This game is a fun and interactive way for visitors to my portfolio to test their memory skills while also exploring my GitHub projects.  The game consists of a grid of cards, each with a unique icon or image related to one of my GitHub projects. The objective of the game is to find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time. Each turn, players can select two cards to flip over. If they match, they will stay face up and the player will earn points. If they do not match, they will flip back over and the player will need to try again.  As players progress through the game, the grid will increase in size and the number of unique icons will also increase, making it more challenging to remember where each card is located. Players can keep track of their progress with a scorecard that shows their current score, the number of moves they have made, and the amount of time they have spent playing.  My GitHub Memory Game is a great way for visitors to my portfolio to engage with my projects in a fun and interactive way. It's also a great way to challenge themselves and test their memory skills. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this game is a fun way to explore my portfolio and have fun at the same time. Give it a try and see how well you can remember my GitHub projects!
